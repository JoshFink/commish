# Authentication Setup Instructions

## Overview
The application now includes simple password authentication with 24-hour session persistence. Users must enter a password to access the application, and their authentication will persist for 24 hours.

## Required Configuration

### Streamlit Secrets
You need to add the following to your Streamlit secrets configuration:

#### For Streamlit Cloud:
1. Go to your app settings in Streamlit Cloud
2. Navigate to the "Secrets" section
3. Add the following entry:

```toml
APP_PASSWORD = "your_secure_password_here"
```

#### For Local Development:
Create or update `.streamlit/secrets.toml` in your project directory:

```toml
[default]
APP_PASSWORD = "your_secure_password_here"

# Your existing secrets...
OPENAI_ORG_ID = "your_openai_org_id"
OPENAI_API_PROJECT_ID = "your_project_id"
OPENAI_COMMISH_API_KEY = "your_api_key"
```

## How Authentication Works

1. **Initial Access**: Users see a login form when first visiting the app
2. **Password Entry**: Users enter the password configured in `APP_PASSWORD`
3. **Session Management**: Upon successful login, a timestamp is stored in session state
4. **24-Hour Persistence**: Users remain logged in for 24 hours from their last successful login
5. **Automatic Expiry**: After 24 hours, users must re-enter the password

## Security Features

- Password is stored securely in Streamlit secrets (not in code)
- Session timestamps prevent indefinite access
- Failed login attempts show user-friendly error messages
- No cookies or external storage - uses Streamlit's built-in session state

## Implementation Details

The authentication system includes:

- `check_authentication()`: Main authentication logic
- Session state management with `authenticated` and `auth_timestamp` keys
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions
- User-friendly login interface with proper form handling

## Testing

Authentication logic has been tested with:
- ✅ Fresh timestamps (< 24 hours) - Valid access
- ✅ Expired timestamps (> 24 hours) - Requires re-login
- ✅ Correct password handling
- ✅ Incorrect password error handling
- ✅ Session state persistence simulation

## Integration

The authentication check runs at the beginning of the main app function, ensuring all application features are protected behind the password barrier.
