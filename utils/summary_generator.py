   - Mock the pretenders, praise the contenders
   - Make predictions and throw shade at playoff hopes
   - Be SNARKY about team management decisions

3. **MATCHUP-BY-MATCHUP DESTRUCTION** (This is the MAIN EVENT - be thorough):
   For EVERY SINGLE matchup, provide:
   - A creative nickname/storyline for each game ("The Bloodbath," "David vs Goliath," etc.)
   - Detailed play-by-play style commentary on what happened
   - ROAST poor performances mercilessly (within trash talk level {trash_talk_level})
   - Celebrate great performances with over-the-top praise
   - Make jokes about team names, player choices, and strategies
   - Include specific point totals and what they mean
   - Create dramatic narratives around close games and blowouts
   - Don't just report scores - tell the STORY of each battle

4. **HEROES AND VILLAINS OF THE WEEK** (2-3 paragraphs):
   - Crown the week's MVP with fanfare
   - Publicly shame the biggest busts and disappointments  
   - Highlight clutch performances and epic failures
   - Make it personal and hilarious

5. **THE WEEKLY AWARDS CEREMONY**:
   - "Manager of the Week" (with sarcastic reasoning)
   - "Worst Decision Award" (roast bad start/sit choices)
   - "Luckiest SOB Award" 
   - "Most Disappointing Roster Award"
   - Be creative with categories and RUTHLESS with commentary

6. **TRASH TALK AND PREDICTIONS**:
   - Unleash appropriate trash talk (level {trash_talk_level}/10)
   - Make bold predictions for next week
   - Call out managers by name for their successes/failures
   - End with a memorable one-liner or challenge

WRITING STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Write 1500-2500 words minimum - make it SUBSTANTIAL
- Channel {character_choice} personality throughout
- Use humor, sarcasm, and wit liberally
- Include sports analogies and pop culture references
- Be entertaining AF - this should be the highlight of their week
- Make managers want to share this with everyone
- Don't just list stats - weave them into compelling narratives
- Be detailed enough that someone who didn't watch can visualize everything

REMEMBER: This isn't just a summary - it's ENTERTAINMENT. Make it legendary.
